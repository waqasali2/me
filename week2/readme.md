TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
"""Today i have learned the if, for, else, elif commands. they were extremely helpful, essentially they provide a choice if something is x  it will print...,  elif if it is y it will print..., else if it is something other than those two it will print...""" 

#This week was far more diifcult than last week but it eventually worked out 

"""EXERCISE0 
In this exercies i learnt how to add numbers and how to convert an integer into a sting. To CONVERT TO A STRING we must follow the following format:

str(some_number)

To make a string UPPERCASE OR LOWERCASE: 

some_word.upper() or some_word.lower()

To add strings together 

"hello" + " " + "there" (the " " gives it a space)"""
