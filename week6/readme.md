TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This was very similar to the week 4 conetent, we wanted to acces a dictionary and keep diving in until we got what we wanted, grabbing the co-ordinates and finally CALLING A TAXI

IMPORTANT NOTE: The co-ordinate system of a computer is diffreent, lowest corners have the biggest values and upper corners have the smallest value 

So if you want the computer to realise that you are calling a taxi you want the y-co of yr wrist to be less than that of yr shoulder
