TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

"""Today i learned how to print a string, it follows the following syntax print("x")
The print function outputs to your console window whatever it is you want to PRINT out
 e.g if you write print("Hello"), it will print Hello to your console"""
